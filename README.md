# RouletteTrackerApp

## Overview

RouletteTrackerApp is a practical tool designed to help track roulette numbers more efficiently and accurately. Created for my father, a mechanical engineer, the app helps him validate his theory that physical roulette tables could exhibit mechanical biases. By automating number tracking and calculations, this app saves significant time and minimizes human error.

### Features:
- **Easy-to-use UI/UX**: User-friendly interface for quick data entry and real-time updates.
- **Automatic Calculation**: The app suggests optimal betting numbers based on past results, eliminating the need for manual calculations.
- **Efficient Tracking**: Tracks and displays the last 37 roulette numbers, with options to customize limits for unique number tracking.
- **Cycle and History View**: Provides an overview of current and past number cycles for better strategy planning.
- **Multi-Page Support**: Manage up to five different roulette pages for varied datasets.

### Problem Solved:
Before this app, my father spent around 4 minutes manually recording results and making calculations with a high risk of human error. This app has streamlined the process, allowing him to track data instantly and with greater accuracy, using the power of software to solve a real-world challenge.

### Tech Stack:
- **Kivy**: Python framework used to build the cross-platform app with intuitive UI.
- **Python**: Core programming language for app logic and algorithms.
